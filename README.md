# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data

This project uses Python and its libraries to wrangle data with Jupyter Notebook for documentation, analysis, and visualizations. 

The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.
